# Elevvo Internship: Data Science & Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science and machine learning projects developed during my internship at Elevvo. These projects demonstrate a range of skills in areas including supervised learning (regression and classification), unsupervised learning (clustering), deep learning for computer vision, and recommender systems.

## 1. üìà Student Score Prediction

* **File:** `Student_Score_Prediction.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To predict a student's percentage score based on the number of hours they study. This project serves as a practical introduction to supervised learning.
* **Methodology:**
    1.  **Data Exploration:** Visualized the relationship between hours studied and scores.
    2.  **Model Training:** Implemented a Simple Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn to capture the linear relationship in the data.
    3.  **Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine its predictive accuracy.

## 2. üõçÔ∏è Mall Customer Segmentation

* **File:** `Mall Costumer Segmentation using Kmeans and DBSCAN.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. This helps the marketing team target different customer groups with tailored strategies.
* **Methodology:**
    1.  **Unsupervised Learning:** Applied clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings within the data without pre-existing labels.
    2.  **K-Means Clustering:** Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) and trained the K-Means model.
    3.  **DBSCAN:** Implemented DBSCAN as an alternative, density-based clustering method.
    4.  **Visualization:** Utilized PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality and visualize the resulting customer segments in 2D space.

## 3. üé¨ Movie Recommendation System

* **File:** `Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To build a system that recommends movies to users based on their historical rating data.
* **Methodology:**
    1.  **Dataset:** Utilized the popular MovieLens 100K dataset, which contains user ratings for a wide range of movies.
    2.  **Collaborative Filtering:** Implemented an item-based collaborative filtering approach. The system finds movies that are similar to the ones a user has liked in the past and recommends them.
    3.  **Similarity Matrix:** Calculated the similarity between movies based on the ratings given by users.

## 4. üå≥ Forest Cover Type Classification

* **File:** `Forest_Cover_Type_Classification.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To predict the forest cover type (e.g., Spruce-Fir, Ponderosa Pine) for a given geographical area using only cartographic data.
* **Methodology:**
    1.  **Multi-class Classification:** Tackled a problem with seven distinct cover type classes.
    2.  **Feature Engineering:** Processed and scaled various cartographic variables (like elevation, aspect, and slope) to prepare them for modeling.
    3.  **Model Training:** Trained and evaluated several powerful classification models, likely including ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, to achieve high accuracy.
    4.  **Evaluation:** Used a confusion matrix and classification report to analyze the model's performance on a per-class basis.

## 5. üö¶ German Traffic Sign Recognition

* **File:** `gtsrb-using-cnn-and-mobilenetv2.ipynb`
* **Objective:** To develop a deep learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying German traffic signs from image data.
* **Dataset:** German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
* **Methodology:**
    1.  **Custom CNN:** Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to learn features directly from the traffic sign images.
    2.  **Transfer Learning:** Implemented a more advanced approach using MobileNetV2, a pre-trained model, to leverage its powerful feature extraction capabilities for higher accuracy and faster convergence.
    3.  **Image Preprocessing:** Applied data augmentation and normalization techniques to improve the model's generalization ability.
    4.  **Performance:** Achieved high classification accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning for computer vision tasks.
